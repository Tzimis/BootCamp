<p>In order to be able to use this service you must become a member of our community. Please feel free to register.</p>

<p>If you are offering a service all you have to do is go to your profile and add a service (+ button). While your service is active other people can search for it and request it.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a service use our search. If you find a service that you like, ask for it. A request shall be sent to the provider of the service. Once he sees your request he can either accept it or cancel it. You can use our messaging system to arrange any details. Once the service is performed for you you must go back to your profile, mark it as Complete and rate it. At this point the credit value of the service will be subtracted from your account and will be added to the provider's account.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that you must contribute to the community, providing services, in order to be able to have credits to ask for other members' services. This is a give and take situation.</p>
