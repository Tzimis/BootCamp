Personal Project - Georgios Arvanitakis
---------------------------------------

This my personal project for the 4th week of AFDEMP Bootcamp. It was built using HTML/CSS, Razor Web Pages, EF & SQL Server. No JavaScript was used. 

It implements a part of the functionality we want for our Group Project. The site is about trading services. When someone does a service to another user the time he spends is credited to his account. He can then spend the time earned by asking a service from another user.

The users can communicate by sending messages to each other through our website. This demo only implements the Messages functionality.

In this folder you can find:
- The Projects/T4TMailbox folder of Visual Studio
- The Websites/T4TMailbox folder of Visual Studio
- Backup of the SQL Server DB in .bak and .sql files

A working demo of this project can be found at: http://personal-arvanitakis-t4tmailbox.azurewebsites.net/
